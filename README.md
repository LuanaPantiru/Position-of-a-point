# Position-of-a-point
This program checks position of a point relative to convex polygon in R^2. We draw a horizontal line to the right of each point and extend it to "infinity". After that we count the numbers of intersection between the line and the polygon. If the count is odd or the point is on the edge on polygon, then the point is inside of polygon, else it is outside of poligon.
